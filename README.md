Speed Scribbling is an online multiplayer game built using Java.

# Gameplay

A shared game board is divided into boxes of 4 by 4 and is synced with all players in real time. Each player is assigned a different pen color. The objective of the game is to take over the most number of boxes. In order to take over a box, a player needs to color at least 50% of the area of the box. While a box is being taken over by a player, other players will see a cross on top of the box. If a player lets go off the pen before the color covers at least 50% of the area of the box, the color will be reset to 0% and the box will be available to any player to take over again. Once a box has been taken by a player, the box can no longer be taken over by any other player. Finally, when all boxes have been taken over, the player who has the most number of boxes will win the game.

*Note: only one device was used in the demo video but the game is meant be played on multiple devices!*
